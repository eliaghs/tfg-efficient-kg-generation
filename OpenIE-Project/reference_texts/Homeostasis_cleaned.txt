The metabolic_processes_of_all_organisms can only take place in very specific_physical_and_chemical_environments. The conditions vary with each organism, and also with whether the chemical_processes take place_inside_the_cell or in the interstitial_fluid bathing the cells. The best-known homeostatic mechanisms in humans_and_other_mammals are regulators that keep the composition of the extracellular_fluid (or the "internal environment") constant, especially with regard to the temperature, ph, osmolality, and the concentrations of sodium, potassium, glucose, carbon_dioxide, and oxygen. However, a great_many_other_homeostatic_mechanisms, encompassing many aspects of human_physiology, control other entities in the body. Where the levels_of_variables are higher or lower than those needed, they are often prefixed with hyper- and hypo-, respectively such as hyperthermia_and_hypothermia_or_hypertension_and_hypotension.
