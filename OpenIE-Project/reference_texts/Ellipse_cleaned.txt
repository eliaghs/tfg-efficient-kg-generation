conic_sections can also be described by a set_of_points_in_the_coordinate_plane. Later in this chapter, we will see that the graph_of_any_quadratic_equation_in_two_variables is a conic_section. The signs_of_the_equations_and_the_coefficients_of_the_variable_terms determine the shape. This section focuses on the four variations_of_the_standard_form_of_the_equation_for_the_ellipse. An ellipse is the set of all points (x,y)(x,y) in a plane such that the sum of their distances from two fixed_points is a constant. Each fixed_point is called a focus (plural: foci).
We can draw an ellipse using a piece of cardboard, two thumbtacks, a pencil, and string. Place the thumbtacks in the cardboard to form the foci_of_the_ellipse. Cut a piece_of_string longer than the distance_between_the_two_thumbtacks (the length_of_the_string represents the constant in the definition). tack each end_of_the_string to the cardboard, and trace a curve with a pencil held taut against the string. The result is an ellipse. See figure_3.
