utilitarianism is one of the most powerful_and_persuasive_approaches_to_normative_ethics_in_the_history_of_philosophy. Though not fully articulated until the 19th_century, proto-utilitarian_positions can be discerned throughout the history_of_ethical_theory.
Though there are many varieties of the view discussed, utilitarianism is generally held to be the view that the morally_right_action is the action that produces the most good. There are many ways to spell out this general_claim. One thing to note is that the theory is a form_of_consequentialism: the right_action is understood entirely in terms of consequences produced. What distinguishes utilitarianism from egoism has to do with the scope_of_the_relevant_consequences. On the utilitarian_view one ought to maximize the overall_good — that is, consider the good_of_others as well as one's own good.
The classical_utilitarians, jeremy_bentham_and_john_stuart_mill, identified the good with pleasure, so, like epicurus, were hedonists_about_value. They also held that we ought to maximize the good, that is, bring about ‘the greatest_amount of good_for_the_greatest_number’.
