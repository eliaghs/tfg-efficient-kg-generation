Basketball Notes
The Rules
Basketball is a team sport. Two teams of five players each try to score by shooting
a ball through a hoop elevated 10 feet above the ground. The game is played on a
rectangular floor called the court, and there is a hoop at each end. The court is
divided into two main sections by the mid-court line (10 second line). If the
offensive team puts the ball into play behind the mid-court line, it has ten
seconds to get the ball over the mid-court line. If it doesn't, then the defense gets
the ball. Once the offensive team gets the ball over the mid-court line, it can no
longer have possession of the ball in the area in back of the line. If it does, the
defense is awarded the ball.
Defensive Player
The ball is moved down the court toward the basket by passing
or dribbling. The team with the ball is called the offense.
The team without the ball is called the defense.
They try to steal the ball, contest shots, steal and deflect passes,
and garner rebounds.
